--  This package defines the aspects that are recognized by GNAT in aspect
--  specifications. It also contains the subprograms for storing/retrieving
--  aspect specifications from the tree. The semantic processing for aspect
--  specifications is found in Sem_Ch13.Analyze_Aspect_Specifications.

------------------------
-- Adding New Aspects --
------------------------

--  In general, each aspect should have a corresponding pragma, so that the
--  newly developed functionality is available for Ada versions < Ada 2012.
--  When both are defined, it is convenient to first transform the aspect into
--  an equivalent pragma in Sem_Ch13.Analyze_Aspect_Specifications, and then
--  analyze the pragma in Sem_Prag.Analyze_Pragma.

--  To add a new aspect, you need to do the following

--    1. Create a name in snames.ads-tmpl

--    2. Create a value in type Aspect_Id in this unit

--    3. Add a value for the aspect in the global arrays defined in this unit

--    4. Add code for the aspect in Sem_Ch13.Analyze_Aspect_Specifications.
--       This may involve adding some nodes to the tree to perform additional
--       treatments later.

--    5. If the semantic analysis of expressions/names in the aspect should not
--       occur at the point the aspect is defined, add code in the adequate
--       semantic analysis procedure for the aspect. For example, this is the
--       case for aspects Pre and Post on subprograms, which are pre-analyzed
--       at the end of the declaration list to which the subprogram belongs,
--       and fully analyzed (possibly with expansion) during the semantic
--       analysis of subprogram bodies.

   -- Handling of Aspect Specifications in the Tree --
   ---------------------------------------------------

   --  Several kinds of declaration node permit aspect specifications in Ada
   --  2012 mode. If there was room in all the corresponding declaration nodes,
   --  we could just have a field Aspect_Specifications pointing to a list of
   --  nodes for the aspects (N_Aspect_Specification nodes). But there isn't
   --  room, so we adopt a different approach.

   --  The following subprograms provide access to a specialized interface
   --  implemented internally with a hash table in the body, that provides
   --  access to aspect specifications.

   function Permits_Aspect_Specifications (N : Node_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Returns True if the node N is a declaration node that permits aspect
   --  specifications in the grammar. It is possible for other nodes to have
   --  aspect specifications as a result of Rewrite or Replace calls.

   function Aspect_Specifications (N : Node_Id) return List_Id;
   --  Given a node N, returns the list of N_Aspect_Specification nodes that
   --  are attached to this declaration node. If the node is in the class of
   --  declaration nodes that permit aspect specifications, as defined by the
   --  predicate above, and if their Has_Aspects flag is set to True, then this
   --  will always be a non-empty list. If this flag is set to False, then
   --  No_List is returned. Normally, the only nodes that have Has_Aspects set
   --  True are the nodes for which Permits_Aspect_Specifications would return
   --  True (i.e. the declaration nodes defined in the RM as permitting the
   --  presence of Aspect_Specifications). However, it is possible for the
   --  flag Has_Aspects to be set on other nodes as a result of Rewrite and
   --  Replace calls, and this function may be used to retrieve the aspect
   --  specifications for the original rewritten node in such cases.

   procedure Set_Aspect_Specifications (N : Node_Id; L : List_Id);
   --  The node N must be in the class of declaration nodes that permit aspect
   --  specifications and the Has_Aspects flag must be False on entry. L must
   --  be a non-empty list of N_Aspect_Specification nodes. This procedure sets
   --  the Has_Aspects flag to True, and makes an entry that can be retrieved
   --  by a subsequent Aspect_Specifications call. It is an error to call this
   --  procedure with a node that does not permit aspect specifications, or a
   --  node that has its Has_Aspects flag set True on entry, or with L being an
   --  empty list or No_List.

   function Find_Aspect (Ent : Entity_Id; A : Aspect_Id) return Node_Id;
   --  Find value of a given aspect from aspect list of entity

   procedure Move_Aspects (From : Node_Id; To : Node_Id);
   --  Moves aspects from 'From' node to 'To' node. Has_Aspects (To) must be
   --  False on entry. If Has_Aspects (From) is False, the call has no effect.
   --  Otherwise the aspects are moved and on return Has_Aspects (To) is True,
   --  and Has_Aspects (From) is False.

   function Same_Aspect (A1 : Aspect_Id; A2 : Aspect_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Returns True if A1 and A2 are (essentially) the same aspect. This is not
   --  a simple equality test because e.g. Post and Postcondition are the same.
   --  This is used for detecting duplicate aspects.

   procedure Tree_Write;
   --  Writes contents of Aspect_Specifications hash table to the tree file

   procedure Tree_Read;
   --  Reads contents of Aspect_Specifications hash table from the tree file

end Aspects;
